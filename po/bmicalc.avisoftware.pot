"<h3>body mass index (BMI)</h3>\n"
"                             The body mass index (BMI), is a value derived "
"from the mass (weight) and height of an individual.\n"
"                             The BMI is an attempt to quantify the amount of "
"tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) in an individual,\n"
"                             and then categorize that person as "
"underweight,\n"
"                             normal weight, overweight, or obese based on "
"that value.\n"
"                             <h4>BMI in Children (aged 2 to 20)</h4>\n"
"                             BMI is used differently for children. It is "
"calculated in the same way as for adults,\n"
"                             but then compared to typical values for other "
"children of the same age.\n"
"                             Instead of comparison against fixed thresholds "
"for underweight and overweight,\n"
"                             the BMI is compared against the percentile for "
"children of the same gender and age.\n"
